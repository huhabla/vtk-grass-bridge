vtkGRASSBridge

A bridge between the GRASS GIS library and VTK.

The support is currently limited to the basic gis, raster and vector map functions of libgrass_gis,
libgrass_vector and libgrass_raster.

The library works only with VTK version 7.0 and grass7.1 development version.

The GRASS shared libraries as well as the VTK and vtkGRASSBridge
libraries must be present in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to use the vtkGRASSBridge
functions in your C++ program.

Python and Java support:
To enable Python and Java support, you need a VTK installation with Python
and Java support.
The VTK Python and Java shared libraries as well as the vtkGRASSBridge libraries
must be present in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH varaible.
The VTK and vtkGRASSBridge Python libraries must be present in your PYTHONPATH.

To use the vtkGRASSBridge in Java programs, the vtkGRASSBridge java classes
must be included in the vtk.jar file.

GRASS library linking:
cmake tries to find the grass shared libraries and include files based on the paths
specified in CMAKe/FindGRASS.cmake.
Modify the paths listed there to your grass installation directory.

Have fun :)
